	Based on my results The fastest type of code for the sort was the C++ array. The C++ array
sorted in basically no time at all until it handled an array with 100000 numbers, and the average time with
100000 numbers was 5.33 ms.

	The array in java was quick, but not as quick as the C++ array. It sorted 10000 numbers in
7.66 ms and 100000 numbers in 16.33 ms.

	The C++ vector was faster than the java array until the 100000 number sort. The vector
sorted 1000 numbers in 1.33 ms, 10000 numbers in 5.33 ms, and 100000 numbers in 51.66 ms
