<h2>Painting</h2>
<p class="desc"><a href="paintroom.jpg."><img src="paintroom_small.jpg" alt="Painted room" class="floatright" /></a>
We were selling our home and needed a room painted quickly. Pete's team promptly came out and gave an estimate. It was quite reasonably priced. They started and finished the very next day! &mdash; The Morris Family</p>

<h2>Remodeling</h2>
<p class="desc"><a href="undecorate.jpg"><img src="undecorate_small.jpg" alt="Plain room" class="floatright" /></a>
We needed to &quot;undecorate&quot; a room &mdash; the previous owners had been a little too creative. Pete's team provided an estimate, promptly began work, and within  a few days our room was looking great! &mdash; The Felkes</p>
