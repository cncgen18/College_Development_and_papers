<p>
We were selling our home and needed a room painted quickly. Pete's team promptly came out and gave an estimate. It was quite reasonably priced. They started and finished the very next day! &mdash; The Morris Family</p>

<h2>Remodeling</h2>

We needed to &quot;undecorate&quot; a room &mdash; the previous owners had been a little too creative. Pete's team provided an estimate, promptly began work, and within  a few days our room was looking great! &mdash; The Felkes</p>
