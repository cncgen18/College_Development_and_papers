  <h1>Gamer for life!!</h1>
  <p>
  I remember as a kid going to my grandmas house just to sit and play
  super mario borthers 3 for hours. Me and my brother never got to beat that game
  till almost ten years later!

  <h2>Xbox > PS3</h2>
  <p>
  Video games have become a part of my life as an addiction, but now it's
  becoming my career. My dream job is to be the brain behind games. As an A.I.
  programmer i will make gamers angry while they face what i create.
