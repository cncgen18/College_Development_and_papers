  <h1>Michael's Homepage</h1>
  <h2> It's all about me</h2>
  <p> 
  This is the homepage to the beginning of YOU learning all about ME. If you don't know me
  that's a shame. I am a very technological guy, I've been playing with technology since I
  was around the age of nine. Computers and games have always facinated me, and i won't stop until
  its my career.
