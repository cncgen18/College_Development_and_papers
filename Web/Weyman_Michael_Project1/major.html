  <h1> Computer Science</h1>
  <p>
  I got into CS for many reasons, here are some.
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>I always loved computers</li>
  <li>I already knew 4 programming languages</li>
  <li>Becoming a game developer has always been a dream</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  So far my classes in college aren't much of a real challenge. Until i get to
  300 level classes i assume it will start to become more challenging. I have a big background
  in computers. I built my first desktop in 5th grade, and have been adding onto it ever since.
